    <h1>Some movies</h1>
    <p>Some of my favorite movies of all time are the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2" title="IMDB for LOTR" target="_blank"><strong>Lord of the Rings</strong></a> movies. 
    They are truly one of the greatest trilogies of movies ever made.</p>
